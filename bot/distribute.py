"""Distribute $LOYALTY by RANK of held_seconds (relative loyalty, not pro-rata).

Layers:
  * `rank_weights` (in bot.ranking, re-exported here) — PURE. Maps held_seconds
    → rank-based weights via a 1/sqrt(rank) curve. Share depends only on your
    POSITION among holders (longest = #1), not on the absolute seconds. cycle.py
    applies this before `distribute`; held_seconds itself stays the value shown
    in stats / the bubble map. It lives in bot.ranking so the key-less web server
    can import the same curve without pulling in bot.config.
  * `compute_payouts` — PURE integer math. Floor division, remainder kept as
    leftover. No holder is ever paid more than their exact share; the sum of
    payouts can never exceed the pool. This is the part proven by unit + stress
    tests (10k holders). It splits by WHATEVER weights it's given, so it's
    unchanged by the rank curve.
  * `distribute` — the I/O layer. Reads the live on-wallet pool (fail-CLOSED),
    builds one CreateIdempotent+TransferChecked tx per recipient, and sends them
    429-resiliently: one blockhash per chunk, bounded concurrency, send-without-
    confirm, then a bulk getSignatureStatuses sweep to tally what actually landed.

`pool` is ALWAYS the live on-wallet balance, never a DB sum — so any drift
(an in-flight tx we stopped polling) self-heals next cycle.
