"""Process launcher: runs the web (server.py) as a keepalive and SUPERVISES the
bot (python -m bot) alongside it, both sharing /data/.

Design:
  - The WEB is the container keepalive. It has NO external dependencies (no
    wallet key, no RPC), so it always boots and serves the read-only site. If the
    web ever dies, that's unexpected, so we exit non-zero and let Railway restart
    the whole container.
  - The BOT is supervised. If it exits — a transient RPC blip, or simply missing
    env before launch — we log it and RESTART it with exponential backoff instead
    of taking the site down with it. So the lander stays up even before the bot is
    fully configured, and a bot crash in production self-heals.

This replaces the old "if either process exits, kill both" behavior, which made
the whole site flap whenever the bot couldn't boot (e.g. before secrets are set).
